How can execute sql script stored in *.sql file using MySQLdb python driver. I was trying


cursor.execute(file(PATH_TO_FILE).read())

but this doesn't work because cursor.execute can run only one sql command at once.
My sql script contains several sql statements instead. Also I was trying


cursor.execute('source %s'%PATH_TO_FILE)
but also with no success.

---answer---

for line in open(PATH_TO_FILE):
    cursor.execute(line)

This assumes you have one SQL statement per line in your file.
Otherwise you'll need to write some rules to join lines together.
